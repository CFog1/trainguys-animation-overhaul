# Trainguy's Animation Overhaul

This repository is for various improvements I'm making to Minecraft's entity animations, all packed into one Fabric 1.18 mod. I try to comment my code the best I can, but if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions my DMs are always open on Discord (trainguy#9512).

## Current Progress

- Animations being implemented but WIP:
    - Player

- Animations previously implemented but need to be worked on further:
    - Shulker box
    - Phantom
    - Bell
    - Ghast
    - Chest

## Additional Credit

This mod wouldn't be nearly as far along ahead without the help from these people!

  - Timeline and Easing systems which serve as a major foundational component for this mod
  - Phantom, Chest, and Shulker Box animations


## FAQ
- What versions will this mod support?
> Upon release, Fabric 1.18+ and maybe snapshots, with updates to future versions released ASAP as long as the mod is still being continued
- Will this mod come to Forge?
> Not sure, but it's not a priority until after release.
- Does this mod support Optifine?
> Optifine is a closed source mod, which makes it much more difficult to figure out what's going wrong through console outputs alone, especially when messing with rendering. If I can get it working, then yes! For now however, it does not. It does however work with Sodium/Iris, which serve as good alternatives.
- Does this mod support mod x?
> Probably! Check the projects tab for a list of mods that have confirmed compatibility, and if you have any more you'd like to add to the list, let me know! My Discord DM's are always open, via Trainguy#9512
