# Trainguy's Animation Overhaul

This repository is for various improvements I'm making to Minecraft's entity animations, all packed into one 1.17.1 Fabric mod. I try to comment my code the best I can, but if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions my DMs are always open on Discord (trainguy#9512).

## Current Progress

- Animations done so far:
    - Nothing yet!
    - Shulker Box
    - Phantom
  
- Animations currently being worked on:
    - Player (this is the most complex one)
    - Chest
    
- Animations planned to come next:
    - Skeleton
    - Zombie
    - Zombified Piglin
    - Piglin
    - Enderman
    
## FAQ
- What versions will this mod support?
> For now, Fabric 1.17.1 and beyond. However, if there's a great enough demand for it I'll put the time into backporting to earlier versions aswell, depending on how different the model animation code is in previous versions.
- Will this mod come to Forge?
> I would like to, but only after I get substantial progress on the main Fabric version.
